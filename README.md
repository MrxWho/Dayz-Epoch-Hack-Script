Dayz-Epoch-Hack-Script
======================

Server Control Script for Dayz Epoch after bypassing the Batteye and others authenticate steps.

REMEMBER: this is not a bypass, it's the scripts that you need to run after bypassing the server in order to control many aspects of that server. There are (maybe) many bypassers out there which can help bypass Battleye, and other Custom-Anti-Cheat on server. Running this script straigth without bypassing authentication step WILL get you immediate ban.

Introduction
========
My friend invited me to play Dayz (Real Virtuality 3 Engine) and asked whether I could find a way to cheat on this game, because he wanted to be on the top list of people on that particular server. After reading through many articles and mods regarding to Dayz (Originally, it's Arma 2 and Arma 2 - Operation Arrowhead game), I found some bypassers that get me through the checking process of Battleye (Main Anti-Cheat). DayZ allows us to use side scripts to control the server (which is what admins use to support players). If your GUID (very unique for each CD-Key) is not set as "admin" and you run those scrips, it would result in immediate and global ban from Batteye. The Game Provider (Bohemia) allows us to use sqf extension to interact with the game. Thing is, how to write and use those script? That's I'm doing right now. 

DayZ Epoch
=======
It's a Mod of DayZ Origins (zombie survival game), for more information please visit:

And this is where I find a lot of resources to finish the script:

How to Use
=======
All the file should be copied to the "Scripts" folder under "Arma 2 - Operation Arrowhead" folder. It also depends on the bypasser that you are using and how they inject the script, but the process is slightly similar (you should read the ReadMe from the bypasser in order to hook up the scripts)

- The main menu will be ajmenu.sqf => the config will be different, i'm using the one from my bypasser provider.
- Read through it, it will link to each individual file inside the script
- Edit the script, if you need a class name or event, look for it in the github above.

Disclaimer
======
- Most of the scripts are found online, but they are seperated files. I combined them together into a menu for easy use.
- Of course cheating will result in ban, keep that in mind. Some admins check for log what of users do, and you are gone.
- Some servers use Custom-Anti-Cheat which will affect the way the bypasser/injector does, sometimes you cannot run the script even though you have bypassed the Batteye check. My recommendation is find another server.
- And finally this github (including all the scripts) are for education/learning purpose only, i take no responsibility that you or someone do with that or whatever relates to it :)
